Hello.

I do wonder what you'll find here.<br>
Treasure? Maybe not. Knowledge? Definitely not. Code? Sure. Bad, ugly code? Indeed. Indeed. As it was meant to be.

There exists something here. Do you see it?<br>
Barebones, clunky - far off in the distance, I see something.<br>
Perhaps it's a start, a start of what I wonder.<br>
Perhaps it is all just a dream.<br>
Or perhaps, it's nothing. Yet with meaning enough, something.<br>
I do wonder where this something will lead you, and me.<br> 
Perhaps it will be fun!<br> 
Or maybe it will be interesting!<br>
Explore now, this something you have found, my little visitor! Explore the depths of laziness coupled with bad code.<br>
May you have fun, I dare say. <br>

*Fun doing what?! Laughing at my code of course! /s*<br>
*I hope my code isn't **that** bad!*

I used to exist as [@dquat](https://github.com/dquat) - but unfortunately, microsoft decided it would be cool to block my email, user.some1@outlook.com for a very very dumb reason: 
<br/>
Accessing my account through many locations

My new email is: user.soem1@gmail.com - I hope I can trust Google not to block my email

For those of you wanting an update on [Matriad](https://github.com/dquat/Matriad), you might have to wait a long time - Until my laziness is cured. Or you can force me. Can you?
Also yes, I'm lazy. Very lazy.
