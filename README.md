Hello. 

There exists nothing here.

I used to exist as [@dquat](https://github.com/dquat) - but unfortunately, microsoft decided it would be cool to block my email, user.some1@outlook.com for a very very dumb reason: 
&emsp;Accessing my account through many locations

There wont be much going on here till I finish some part of my higher education.

For those of you wanting an update on [Matriad](https://github.com/dquat/Matriad), you might have to wait a long time - until I can actually get time to write code
